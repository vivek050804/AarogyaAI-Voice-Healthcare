# AarogyaAI ‚Äì Voice-Enabled AI Healthcare Assistant for Remote and Underserved Communities

## Overview
**AarogyaAI** is a transformative idea aimed at bridging the healthcare gap for rural and underserved populations in India. With the power of voice-based AI, this initiative seeks to empower individuals, especially those who are illiterate or technologically unskilled, by providing accessible, intuitive, and essential medical support via mobile phones or smart devices. 

Our vision is to make healthcare communication as simple as talking to a friend, in one's native language, using basic devices.
